            I compete in multiple dog sports with my dogs. Through these sports,
            I have met a great community of people and improved my relationship
            with my dogs. Ultimately, this has inspired me to become a dog trainer.

            There are clubs all over the world that compete in this
            world wide league. The basic idea is to throw a disc as
            far as you can and have your dog catch it. The further 
            the throw, the more points you get.

            Dock diving is a dog sport in which dogs compete in jumping for
            distance or height from a dock into a body of water. It is
            thought to have originated in 1997 in the United States.

            K9 Nose Work is a fun search and scenting activity that can be
            enjoyed by all dogs and people. It is a great way for your dog
            to have fun, build confidence, and burn lots of mental and
            physical energy.
